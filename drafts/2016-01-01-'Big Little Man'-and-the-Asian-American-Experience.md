You can't begin to talk about the Asian-American experience without talking about penises, squinty eyes, emasculation, self-loathing, and more—and that's exactly the stuff that Alex Tizon gets into in his novel _Big Little Man_.

Although _Big Little Man_ discusses topics of the likes of male genitalia and race relations, it's not written with the fervor and vehemence of Wesley Yang's provocative essay. Rather, _Big Little Man_ approaches the Asian-American experience with a pensive, journalistic approach, with Tizon drawing upon both historical events and his personal experiences to illustrate his take on the modern Asian-American—one that I'm pretty sure many Asians (and even non-Asians) could relate to.

Personally, I know that while reading the novel, I felt a deep connection with Tizon's writings. Tizon wrote about the psyche within myself that was too difficult to put into words.
