>Gone now / Thinking what's gone now / Like a part of me walked out, oh

Today, my bike got stolen.

I've only had it for about six months or so. Film classes were far away. Now, I have to walk.

Walking isn't so bad. I get up earlier. I get more exercise. I'll appreciate my surroundings more. What's life without walking?

But it was because I left my bike unlocked outside. The U-lock has been jammed for weeks now. It's really my fault, I guess, for so long taking something like that for granted. I came back thinking it would be there just as easily I left it but—

—it was gone.

I'm not mad. It was an old, shitty bike. I paid a stranger forty bucks for it. The brakes barely work. I've even hit someone because of it. Good riddance!

I'll find another. One whose wheels don't have gashes. One whose handles aren't crooked. One whose chain doesn't pop off all the time. One whose brakes don't squeal. One who stops you before the curb knocks the smile out of you. I'll be much happier.

But, I can't help but feel...

Today, my bike got stolen. And tomorrow, I will walk.
