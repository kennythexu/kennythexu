Today, while browsing Reddit, I came across a [great comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6k6fdz/happy_10th_birthday_iphone/djjqtek/) written by /u/FizzyBeverage in a thread celebrating the iPhone's 10th anniversary. It was the top comment:

<blockquote>
Thinking back, the iPhone, in one generation or another has been the most consistent resident of my pocket for the last decade- more than my wallet even. It was in my pocket when I interviewed to work at Apple, and when I went to Mac Genius training in Cupertino and briefly met Steve Jobs himself in line at Caffe Macs. It was there when I had coffee with a sweet girl on our first date (she had her iPhone 3G on the coffee table too), and when I walked down the aisle to marry this girl a few years later, an iPhone 5 was in the tuxedo pocket. The iPhone 5S and 6S cameras filmed both of my daughter's births, first steps, first time eating spaghetti, first smile... and so many other milestones.
<br><br>
Angry Birds, Flight Control, Facebook, Instagram- more recently my credit cards through ApplePay and airline boarding passes whenever I fly.
<br><br>
As a former Mac Genius, I've seen thousands of iPhones broken/smashed/bent/burned/shattered... rarely if ever did an owner not pursue a repair or replacement- even at considerable repair cost, their iPhone just means that much to them.
<br><br>
I've owned plenty of gadgets, multiple Macs and Windows machines, tablets, readers and iPads too... but none of these are consistently on me and within immediate reach like the iPhone is. Funny thing is, just about everyone reading this has a similar story about the phone in their pocket.

Like FizzyBeverage, the iPhone for me is kind of like another companion. Obviously, it's usually in my pocket. But when I take it out so it can see the world, it can record so much of it, and reveal so much more of the world right back to me. It's always been there for me, almost like another limb on my body that I can't quite live without. Although it's something that I _can_ live without—and even gone without it for multiple weeks with no issue—I still feel that without my iPhone, life's not quite the same without my trusty companion.

This may sound somewhat sad, especially if you're a reminiscent reader who longs for simpler times (which I at times agree with), but that's the way the world is moving. The iPhone has become part of so many people's lives, from [Kim Jong-Un](http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2014/11/even-north-koreas-kim-jong-un-loves-his-iphone-6.html) to [infants and toddlers](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-babies-screen-time-iphone-ipad-20150424-story.html). Perhaps for many of us, the iPhone is something we take for granted. We never stop to thank our eyes and ears for helping us experience life's colors and sounds. And we also never stop to thank our iPhone for keeping us connected and close with friends—not that we need to go out and physically genuflect to our phones—but shouldn't we be more thankful for something that helps us literally _all the time_?

In the [2007 presentation of the original iPhone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4U5FqrOdQ), Steve Jobs presents the iPhone by saying he's going to unveil three devices, "a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communications device." Of course, in the end he was revealing just one device that did all three of those things at once. Clever dude.

Today, it's quite obvious that the iPhone does so much more than just those three things. It's as if, over time, the iPhone—with all the years it's been with us—has learned more and more about us, and how it can better help us just _live_. To live better and more efficiently.

It's no secret that society today relies on iPhones and mobile phones so much. It's something we inadvertently take everywhere with us whether we like it or not, but in the end, we're always glad it's there sitting in our pocket. FizzyBeverage depicts a poignant picture. The iPhone is a loyal companion. There for us to forget about and there for us when we need it the most. And maybe soon enough the iPhone will be an actual [part of our bodies](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html). A scary thought, but something to talk about another time.

Neverthless, here's to another 10 years, iPhone.
