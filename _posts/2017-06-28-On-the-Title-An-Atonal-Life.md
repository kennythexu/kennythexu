>Play any little phrase they will hear it in some key—it may not be the right one, but the point is they will play it with a tonal sense. ... [T]he more I feel I know Schoenberg's music the more I believe he thought that way himself. ... And it isn't only the players; it's also the listeners. They will hear tonality in everything.

"Atonal," according to the _Collins English Dictionary_, refers to music __without a tonal center or key.__

It's used to describe music that goes against the fundamental idea of _tonality_—against traditional Western "rules" of music. Atonality abandons much of conventional music's rigid forms of cadence and resolve and its techniques of themes, motifs, and contour for something completely different. Something completely radical.

In context with music's long history, atonal music is really more of a recent development, only really beginning in the early 20th century with the like of composers Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern. Prominent influencers of atonality, Schoenberg and Webern composed pieces that sounded more ambiguous... less predictable, and overall, controversial. Many critics declared atonality as ridiculous, rebellious, and bizarre.

To put it simply, it was an odd contrarian movement. Full on twelve-tone serialism and atonality never quite made it mainstream, but people began to slowly embrace its parts and quirks. Over a hundred years later from its inception, we can pretty easily find atonal influences in not only orchestral music, but much of jazz, film soundtracks, and even rock.

As I enter young adulthood, inexperienced with a brain primed and pumped for learning, I feel that I keep coming across a common theme: _no one really knows what they're doing_. That includes me, of course.

We may be wandering about without a plan, maybe convincing ourselves of following some vague purpose that we've been told to do. We're out of center and out of key. Maybe we do this on accident. Maybe on purpose. But even in the face of all this vagrancy and atonality, I think that it's all okay.

In music, we naturally want to hear tonality—some kind of order and resolve. We want to hear Fur Elise end on an A. We want certain patterns in both classical and pop music. It's just how we're wired. In the same way, I think we're also intended to desire a similar sort of order in our lives. We want to know what our perfect career path is. We want to hear that "yes" that we've been waiting for. We want to feel wanted and fulfilled and find that perfect balance in our lives.

We want life to make sense—to be comfortable and predictable. But it never is, is it?

Atonality isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just means we're on the road, riding along on a journey for direction and purpose later in our lives. We may have "atonal" moments in our lives. We may find along the way some sort of confusion and misdirection. But ultimately, it's the last series of notes that matter.

And there—I think we'll all find our own resolve.
