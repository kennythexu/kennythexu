"Biweek" isn't a word. But I haven't got another way to say "here are some highlights of the music that I've been listening to for the past two weeks."

Anyhow, I thought I'd share what I've been listening to for the past two weeks, and maybe you'll find it interesting enough to give a listen. I'll set one ground rule for myself though: the album, song, and artist of the "biweek" should not overlap with each other. So for instance, if Childish Gambino's "Redbone" was my song of the biweek, then I wouldn't use the album _Awaken, My Love!_ or Childish Gambino for any of the other categoriesâ€”just to force some variety upon myself. Have a look:
