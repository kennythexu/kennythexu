I've just got back from China, and I've realized I haven't posted in a while. It's been difficult finding something that I really want to write about. But now, I think I've found something: Asian hair. It's something that I've had all my life, and something that's also frustrated me (and many other Asians) almost all my life, too.

Here, let me get right down to it. White people hair—the hair that most people have in America—usually goes something like this:

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/Rant - Asian Hair/whitehair.jpg" alt="White Hair" style="width: 400px;"></p>

On the sides, the hair grows downwards. With Asian hair, you usually get this:

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/Rant - Asian Hair/porcupinehair.jpg" alt="Porcupine Hair" style="width: 400px;"></p>

As you can see from my beautiful MS Paint art, Asian hair annoyingly sticks out on the sides like a porcupine. Waxes, pomades, mousses—they all don't work to keep it down. The hair is far too thick and stiff.

So at medium length, my hair looks unkempt and my head looks awkward and fat. This makes it extremely hard to style, and really only looks half-decent if it's super short or super long—when the weight of the hair can finally overpower the thick, stubborn hair follicles. For me, I decide to keep it short and tight, kind of like a disconnected undercut. Unfortunately, that means I have to get my haircut pretty often—something like every 2-3 weeks.

There are other options out there, however. One option open for people like me is to get a "down perm." It's essentially a perm that's only for the sides and back of a person's hair, so that the hair—fused with chemicals—finally quits its shitty attitude and stays down. But it's a relatively new Korean invention, and simply isn't available in middle America where I am (California probably has more of these places). I mean, when's the last time you've seen an Asian salon in Cincinnati (hit me up if you know of one)?

Or, I could try this:

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/Rant - Asian Hair/MagicMohican.jpg" alt="Magic Mohican"></p>

It's essentially earmuffs but without the ears part, so it flattens only the sides of your hair. A lot of Asian males like me have tried wearing hats to flatten the sides, so why not try this nifty invention? ...It's funny isn't it? Nevertheless, Asian males in the world have thought about this stiff hair problem through and through and the only viable options are to get a perm, cut it super short, or grow it out really long.

Moreover, it's also difficult to find a good barber—at least around Cincinnati. Barbers around here aren't usually of Asian descent. They're usually white or black, and frankly, many of them don't have the best experience cutting Asian hair. I don't blame them, though. When you're cutting white people hair all the time and yellow dudes come in once in a blue moon, you're probably not gonna have the most experience cutting Asian hair. That's just the way it is.

So if you ask for something like this...

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/Rant - Asian Hair/Ryan-Gosling.jpg" alt="Ryan Gosling" style="width: 400px;"></p>

You'll likely end up looking like this:

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/Rant - Asian Hair/Asian-Hair.jpg" alt="Asian Hair" style="width: 400px;"></p>

Or this:

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/Rant - Asian Hair/Asian-Hair2.jpg" alt="Asian Hair 2" style="width: 400px;"></p>

If only I could pull off this...

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/Rant - Asian Hair/Asian Flat Top.jpg" alt="Asian Flat Top" style="width: 400px;"></p>

Hopefully your barber will just let you know that Ryan Gosling's genetics aren't for everybody.

Reflecting on this, I feel frustrated. Many Asian males not only have this exact same problem, but face a lot of other struggles in America. And it's stupid. Why do we have to go through so many annoying difficulties to just feel like we _fit in with everyone else_? I could go on and on, but I feel that it's kind of pointless. Although my hair frustrates me pretty often, in the end it really doesn't matter all that much, does it?

We all have our own insecurities about how we look and feel. Whether it's from our genetics, our noses, our acne, our fat rolls, we all have them. And really, it's trivial. In the end, the stubborn hair and all those other dumb insecurities—no matter how much they suck—are just a small part of our entire selves. When we're so often consumed by our own insecurities, the world around us is fast moving on. The small things we make a big deal out of probably aren't that big of a deal to the people around us in the first place. I'd rather that I spend time enjoying life while it's there. Hopefully you may think the same. Something like looks may get someone somewhere for a little bit, but we all turn out ugly and wrinkly as f*ck in the end.

That's where I try to find solidarity. Everyone's gonna be ugly. Stop being a boring slug and do something cool.

And so I ask you. The next time you see an Asian guy with an ugly ass haircut, give him a break. Maybe buy him an ice cream cone, give him a hug, and tell him that everything will be alright and that life only has so much meaning. I'm just kidding though. About the ice cream obviously.
