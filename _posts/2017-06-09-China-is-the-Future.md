A nation once known for its copycat companies, China is now leading the way in mobile innovation... particularly with these things called _superapps_.

The term ***[super app](http://www.whatsonweibo.com/whatswechat/)*** refers to an app that does basically everything, from social media, group chats, and gaming to vendor payments, taxi booking, and bike rentals—all within their own respective ecosystems.

When I think of these super apps, such as WeChat and Alipay—_Weixin_ and _Zhifubao_ as known by locals—the word "advanced" comes to mind. But maybe that's not the best word to use. Maybe "ubiquitous," or "universal," or "you literally cannot function in Shanghai without WeChat or Alipay." Using these kind of apps, you can even [pay your own water bill](https://www.beijing-kids.com/blog/2015/10/13/net-savings-paying-for-utilities-on-wechat-wallet-and-alipay/) right after you videochat your grandparents or book a movie ticket if you wanted.

As a result, your average Chinese citizen doesn't have to press the home button to do what Americans have to do in a whole slew of different apps.

Now in the U.S., we've got mobile payment systems, too, but none of them can compete with the corresponding standard in China. We've got Venmo, but vendors don't usually accept it and seems exclusively used by college students. We also have Apple Pay, but at least how I see it, Apple's take on mobile payments still seems rather "gimmicky" and isn't something that—in the near future at least—will be as used as pervasively as WeChat Wallet and Alipay are. There are some other apps like Google Wallet, but they're nowhere near comparable to China's behemoth payment systems. For comparison, [China's mobile payment market amounted to $5.5 trillion in 2016, while the United States market was measured at a meager $112 billion](https://www.ft.com/content/00585722-ef42-11e6-930f-061b01e23655?mhq5j=e3). In Shanghai, where I am right now, basically every single vendor accepts Alipay or WeChat payments, and most accept both. Oh well. At least we have _freedom_, right?

Well while I'm in China, though, I'll definitely bask in the glory of the mobile payment future.

# Just look at this.
If you have good enough credit from paying bills and the like, you can borrow a complimentary umbrella or even a portable charger (not pictured) from one of the many stations like these around Shanghai.
