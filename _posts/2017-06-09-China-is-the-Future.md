A nation once known for its copycat manufacturers, but now—China is leading the way in mobile integration... I don't really know what to call it honestly, but it's stuff that's super convenient.

The word "advanced" comes to my mind when I think of China's super apps known as WeChat and Alipay, or _Weixin_ and _Zhifubao_ as they are known by the locals.

But maybe that's not the best word to use. Maybe "ubiquitous," or "universal," or "you literally cannot function in Shanghai without WeChat or Alipay." The name [*super app*](http://www.whatsonweibo.com/whatswechat/) describes an app that does basically everything, from social media, group chats, and gaming to vendor payments, taxi booking, and bike rentals—all within their own respective ecosystems.

With these apps, you can even [pay your own water bill](https://www.beijing-kids.com/blog/2015/10/13/net-savings-paying-for-utilities-on-wechat-wallet-and-alipay/).

As a result, your average Chinese citizen doesn't have to press the home button to do what Americans have to do in a whole bunch of different apps.

Now in the U.S., we've got some mobile payment systems, too, but none of them live up to what they have in China. We have Venmo, but vendors don't usually have it and it seems exclusively used by college students. We also have Apple Pay, but at least how I see it, it still seems rather "gimmicky" and isn't something that—in the near future at least—will be as pervasively used as WeChat Wallet or Alipay are. There are some other apps like Google Wallet, but they're nowhere near comparable to China's behemoth payment systems. China's third-party mobile payments in 2016 was $5.5 trillion, compared to U.S.'s modest $112 billion.

Oh well. At least while I'm in China, I can bask in the glory of the mobile payment future.

If you have good enough credit, you even can rent an umbrella from one of the many stations like these around Shanghai. Building credit is easily done just by using their everyday services like paying your utility bills. Another complimentary privilege you can get with good credit is a portable charger at, again, the many street locations around the city.

Some other cool things you can do....

Rent city bikes! So, so, sooo many bikes.
