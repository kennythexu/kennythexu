So I work right next to this big mall called __Raffles City__, and it's quite a popular destination for food when people in the office building head out for lunch. There are many options, from the big, meaty, and American Carl's Jr. to _Pho Asia_, a South Asian spot serving Vietanamese pho and delicious Thai cuisine. But the most interesting thing about Raffles City isn't its food options, or its complimentary high-speed wifi, or its occasional public makeup demonstration....

It's the fact that this huge mall—with its grandiose number of stores—has no one actually _in the stores_.

Let me demonstrate.
