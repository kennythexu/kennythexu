So I work right next to this big mall called __Raffles City__, and it's quite a popular destination for food when people in the office building head out for lunch. There are many options, from the big, meaty, and American Carl's Jr. to _Pho Asia_, a South Asian spot serving Vietanamese pho and delicious Thai cuisine. But the most interesting thing about Raffles City isn't its food options, or its complimentary high-speed wifi, or its occasional public makeup demonstration....

It's the fact that this huge mall—with its grandiose number of stores—never really has anybody actually _in the stores_.

And it's not that online shopping taking over retail is the cause of the phenomenon that I'm observing—although [online shopping most definitely is a scourge upon retail](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/e-commerce-killing-traditional-retail-220106161.html). If you go to the popular Cloud Nine Shopping Mall also in Shanghai, you'll find that there are a lot of people in the stores. Shopping. Like at any ordinary mall. Cloud Nine is bigger than Raffles City, but not by a significant amount.

I'm starting to suspect that these stores just serve as a front for something. Could be they're just showcasing their products or maybe they could be embezzling drug money. I don't know.

All I know is that these "sale" signs are extremely ambiguous, and one of the first oddities I've noticed since coming here.
