The word "advanced" comes to my mind when I think of China's super app known as WeChat, or Weixin as it is known by the locals.

But maybe that's not the best word to use. Maybe "ubiquitous," or "universal," or "you literally cannot function in China without WeChat or Alipay." Alipay is also an app that offers mobile payment features, except it's not exactly a _super app_. A (*super app*)[http://www.whatsonweibo.com/whatswechat/] is an informal colloquialism to describe an app that basically does everything, from social media, group chats, and gaming to QR code payments, taxi booking, and buying movie ticketsâ€”all within its own ecosystem.

Alipay, or _Zhifubao_, is geared more toward _payments_, and less towards social media. Let me be clear, though. Alipay can still do a whole lot, like even [paying your water bill](https://www.beijing-kids.com/blog/2015/10/13/net-savings-paying-for-utilities-on-wechat-wallet-and-alipay/).

That means you don't have to press the home button to do what Americans have to do in a whole bunch of different apps.
