The word "advanced" comes to my mind when I think of China's super apps known as WeChat and Alipay, or _Weixin_ and _Zhifubao_ and as they are known by the locals.

But maybe that's not the best word to use. Maybe "ubiquitous," or "universal," or "you literally cannot function in Shanghai without WeChat or Alipay." The name (*super app*)[http://www.whatsonweibo.com/whatswechat/] describes an app that does a whole lot of things, from social media, group chats, and gaming to vendor payments, taxi booking, and movie ticket purchases—all within their own respective ecosystems.

You can even [pay your own water bill](https://www.beijing-kids.com/blog/2015/10/13/net-savings-paying-for-utilities-on-wechat-wallet-and-alipay/).

With these apps, you don't have to press the home button to do what Americans have to do in a whole bunch of different apps.

In the U.S., we've got some mobile payment systems. We have Venmo, but it's not used by vendors and seems to be an exclusive college student app. We also have Apple Pay, right? But at least how I see it, it's still in its "gimmicky" stage and isn't something that—in the near future at least—will be widely adopted as it is in China. There are some other smaller systems like Google Wallet, but those are nowhere near comparable to China's payment systems.

But at least while I'm in China, I can bask in the glory of the mobile payment future.
