Every day I take the subway to work. Once at 9am, and then at rush hour 6pm I cram myself shoulder-to-shoulder with hundreds of strangers on the subway straight back to the apartment I'm living in on Weining Road. Some of you might not know, but I'm currently in Shanghai, China (aka [Hoontopia](http://www.barstoolsports.com/barstoolu/if-you-dont-smoke-cigarettes-in-china-you-might-as-well-be-wearing-a-sign-that-says-im-a-virgin/)) right now working as an intern for Aston Martin. I'm living by myself for two months, so I have a lot of free time, and this blog I'm writing is a start to conquering boredom, bright flashing lights, and the _humongous amount_ of people here. Don't get me wrong though. This place is awesome and honestly, far more advanced than much of the U.S.—I'll probably get to that in another post.

Well while I'm on the subway (officially called the Metro), I always got my headphones in, listening to any kind of music—from the early 2000s British rock albums of Coldplay's _Parachutes_ to the like of Kendrick Lamar's _DAMN_. For me, music is everywhere.

The name of this blog is "Songs and Stories" because I realize that for much of my life and day-to-day routine—and probably many of you can relate as well—music and any other forms of creativity have been the mirrors of expression and story-telling within my life.

And it's not just listening to music. I can't remember a time when I couldn't read music. It's kind of like speaking English. I can't remember a time when I didn't know how to speak English. In the same way, I couldn't tell you a time that I couldn't read music. I picked up piano when I was around 6, and later I learned to play violin and guitar, making music such a significant and integral part of my life.

Every blog post, I'm gonna try to introduce a sonsg with the post. Something that maybe can speak to the content, or maybe a song that's stuck on replay at the moment, or even just a song that's stuck out to me during my time using public transit for instance. Who knows?

All I know is that I encourage you to put the song on in the background and join me in my thoughts. I've got plenty time for introspection and reflection, and maybe you do too. Maybe my publically-shared thoughts might be interesting, or helpful, or exciting, or surprising, or... whatever. I just appreciate you reading.

Today's song is the well-known lead single off of Frank Ocean's _Blond_, "Nikes," where in and out of the syrupy bass throbs and snare delays you find lyrics like these:

>We laid out on this wet floor / Away turf, no Astro / Mesmerized how the strobes glow / Look at all the people feet dance.

I'll try to put lyrics and the like at the beginning next time. And of course, don't be a stranger. Oh yeah, and my name is Kenny. Nice to meet you.
