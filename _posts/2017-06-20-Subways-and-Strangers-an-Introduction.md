If you don't know, I'm currently in Shanghai, China (aka [Hoontopia](http://www.barstoolsports.com/barstoolu/if-you-dont-smoke-cigarettes-in-china-you-might-as-well-be-wearing-a-sign-that-says-im-a-virgin/)) working as an intern for Aston Martin. I'm living by myself for two months, so with all this free time, I've started a blog to conquer boredom, bright flashing lights, and the other casual annoyances that come with the _humongous_ amount of people here. Don't get me wrong though. This place is awesome and honestly, far more advanced than much of the United States. But don't worry about that, I'll get to that in another post.

Anyway, every day I take the subway to work. Once at 9am, and then at 6pm rush hour I cram myself shoulder-to-shoulder with hundreds of strangers on the subway straight back to the apartment I'm living in on Weining Road. During my time on public transit, I always got my headphones in, listening to any kind of music—from the early 2000s British rock albums of Coldplay's _Parachutes_ to the like of Kendrick Lamar's _DAMN_.

### Music is my peaceful place.

For much of my life—and probably many of you can relate as well—music and other forms of art have been the mirrors of expression and creativity in my life. It's a solace I can escape to and ignore what's going on outside, like the subway's cacophony of people and sounds.

And it's not just listening to music. I can't remember a time when I couldn't read music. It's kind of like speaking English to me. I couldn't tell you a time when I couldn't speak. In the same way, I couldn't tell you a time that I couldn't read music. I picked up piano when I was around 6, and later I learned to play violin and guitar, making music a significant part of my life.

Every post, I'm gonna try to introduce a song with the post. Something that may speak to the content, or maybe a song that's stuck on replay at the moment, or even a song that I've just discovered. You'll see.

All I know is that I encourage you to put the song on in the background and join me in my thoughts. I've got plenty of time for introspection and reflection, and maybe you do too. Perhaps my publically-shared thoughts could be interesting, or helpful, or exciting, or surprising, or... whatever. I just appreciate you reading.

Today's song is the well-known lead single off of Frank Ocean's _Blond_, "[Nikes](https://open.spotify.com/track/19YKaevk2bce4odJkP5L22 "Nikes")," where in and out of the throbbing bass line and snare delay you find lyrics like these:

>We laid out on this wet floor / Away turf, no Astro / Mesmerized how the strobes glow / Look at all the people feet dance.

You know, this place can be pretty at times.

I'll leave you with that. Oh yeah, and my name is Kenny. Nice to meet you.
