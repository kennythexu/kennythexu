The word "advanced" comes to my mind when I think of China's super apps known as WeChat and Alipay, or _Weixin_ and _Zhifubao_ as they are known by the locals.

But maybe that's not the best word to use. Maybe "ubiquitous," or "universal," or "you literally cannot function in Shanghai without WeChat or Alipay." The name [*super app*](http://www.whatsonweibo.com/whatswechat/) describes an app that does basically everything, from social media, group chats, and gaming to vendor payments, taxi booking, and bike rentals—all within their own respective ecosystems.

With these apps, you can even [pay your own water bill](https://www.beijing-kids.com/blog/2015/10/13/net-savings-paying-for-utilities-on-wechat-wallet-and-alipay/).

As a result, your average Chinese citizen doesn't have to press the home button to do what Americans have to do in a whole bunch of different apps.

Now in the U.S., we've got some mobile payment systems, too, but none of them live up to what they have in China. We have Venmo, but it's not widely-used by vendors and seems exclusively used by college students. We also have Apple Pay, but at least how I see it, it still seems rather "gimmicky" and isn't something that—in the near future at least—will be as pervasively used as WeChat Wallet or Alipay. There are some other smaller apps like Google Wallet, but they're nowhere near comparable to China's behemoth payment systems.

But at least while I'm in China, I can bask in the glory of the mobile payment future.

If you have good enough credit, you even can rent an umbrella from one of the many stations like these around Shanghai. You can easily build credit by just using their everyday services. Another cool thing you can get with good credit is a portable charger at again—many places around the city.

Some other cool things....

Rent city bikes! So, so, sooo many bikes.



Communal mail boxes that open up with a unique code given to you!



Scan so many QR codes for coupons and other cool stuff!



Get hot food and groceries delivered to your home, often in less than 30 minutes!



Welp, I feel like I'm advertising something at this point, so I'll stop.
