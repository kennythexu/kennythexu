>Play any little phrase they will hear it in some key—it may not be the right one, but the point is they will play it with a tonal sense. ... [T]he more I feel I know Schoenberg's music the more I believe he thought that way himself. ... And it isn't only the players; it's also the listeners. They will hear tonality in everything.

"Atonal," according to the _Collins English Dictionary_, refers to music __without a tonal center or key.__

Placed within the entire timeline of music, atonal music is more of a recent musical development, beginning only in the early 20th century. Composers like Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern informally led this small movement of music that went against the idea of _tonality_—against traditional Western "rules" of music, abandoning much of its rigid forms of cadence and resolve and its techniques of themes, motifs, contour, and more. The music sounded more ambiguous, less predictable. It was controversial. Polemical. Ridiculous. Contrarian. Bizarre.

To put it simply, it was an odd, rebellious movement. Twelve-tone serialism and atonality never quite made it mainstream, but people began to slowly embrace its quirks. Today, it's easy to find atonal influences in not only classical music, but much of jazz, film soundtracks, and even rock.

As I enter young adulthood, fully inexperienced with a brain sponged for learning, I feel that I keep coming across a common theme: _no one really knows what they're doing_.

Including me, of course.

We may be wandering about without a plan, maybe convincing ourselves of following some vague purpose that we've been told to do. Maybe we do this on accident. Maybe on purpose. But even with all this vagrancy and atonality, I feel that it's all okay.

In music, we naturally want to hear tonality, some kind of order and resolve. We want to hear Fur Elise end on an A. We desire predictable patterns in both classical and pop music. It's just how we're wired. In the same way, I think we're also wired to find a similar sort of order in our lives.

Atonality isn't a bad thing. It just means we're on the road, on some kind of journey for direction and purpose later in our life. We may have "atonal" moments in our life—some kind of misdirection or confusion—but ultimately, it's the last series of notes that matter.

And one day, we'll find our own resolve.
