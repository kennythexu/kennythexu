"Biweek" isn't a word. But they should make it a word because I can't think of another way to say "here are the highlights of the music that I've been listening to for the past two weeks." Anyhow, The album, song, and artist of the "biweek" will not overlap with each other. So for example, if Childish Gambino's "Redbone" was my song of the biweek, then I wouldn't use the album _Awaken, My Love!_ or Childish Gambino for any of the other categories.
