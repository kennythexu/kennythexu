For info on the weird blog name, [read this post](../journal/On-the-Title-An-Atonal-Life.html) (post in progress). For a bit more info on me, you've come to the right place!

My name is Kenny Xu. First and foremost, I love to learn. Whether it be guitar or photography or programming, at any given time, I'm always learning _something_. It's how I currently live my lifeâ€”keeping myself fresh with new ideas. And in and out of all these various hobbies I have, I plan on sharing my experiences on this blog of mine.

There's always more to learn, and for me using this blog, I get the chance to work on writing and sharing my thoughts.

As of now, I plan on writing just about anything, although probably with a focus on music, technology, and current events. Since it's a bit early for me in this "blog thing," I'd wager that this is all up for change. This whole thing's a work in progress for me. Anyhow, to start, you can read my [first blog post](../journal/Subways-and-Strangers-an-Introduction.html), a sort of introduction.

If you want to reach me, I'm available at kxu2@nd.edu, [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/xukenny), or through any of the little social buttons in the top right corner of this website.
