"Atonal," according to _Collins English Dictionary_, refers to music __"without a tonal center or key."__

Atonal music, placed in the broad scope of music, is more of a recent development, as it was more-or-less "created" in the early 20th century. Composers like Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern informally led this small movement of music that went against traditional Western "rules" of music, from its rigid forms of cadence and resolve to its techniques of themes, motifs, contour, and more. The music sounded ambiguous, less predictable. It was controversial. Polemical. Ridiculous. Bizarre.

To put it simply, it was an odd, novel musical movement.

As I enter my young adulthood, fully inexperienced and everyday, burgeoning with ideas and thoughts left and right, I feel that I find a common theme: _no one really knows what they're doing_. 

"play any little phrase they will hear it in some keyâ€”it may not be the right one, but the point is they will play it with a tonal sense. ... [T]he more I feel I know Schoenberg's music the more I believe he thought that way himself. ... And it isn't only the players; it's also the listeners. They will hear tonality in everything" (Westergaard 1968, 15).

And maybe one day, we'll all find our resolve ;)
