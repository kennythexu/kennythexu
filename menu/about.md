>Play any little phrase they will hear it in some key—it may not be the right one, but the point is they will play it with a tonal sense. ... [T]he more I feel I know Schoenberg's music the more I believe he thought that way himself. ... And it isn't only the players; it's also the listeners. They will hear tonality in everything.

"Atonal," according to _Collins English Dictionary_, refers to music __"without a tonal center or key."__

Placed within the entire timeline of music, atonal music is more of a recent musical development, beginning only in the early 20th century. Composers like Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern informally led this small movement of music that went against the idea of _tonality_—against traditional Western "rules" of music, abandoning much of its rigid forms of cadence and resolve and its techniques of themes, motifs, contour, and more. The music sounded more ambiguous, less predictable. It was controversial. Polemical. Ridiculous. Contrarian. Bizarre.

To put it simply, it was an odd, rebellious movement. Twelve-tone serialism and atonality never quite made it mainstream, but people began to slowly embrace its quirks. Today, it's easy to find atonal influences in not only classical music, but much of jazz, film soundtracks, and even rock.

As I enter my young adulthood, fully inexperienced with a brain sponged for learning, I feel that I keep coming across a common theme: _no one really knows what they're doing_.

our lives may also seem. We may be wandering about without, maybe convincing ourselves of following some vague purpose that we've been told to do. Maybe we do it on purpose. Maybe on accident. But even with all this vagrancy and lack of direction, I feel that it's okay.

In music, we naturally want to hear order and resolve. We want to hear Fur Elise resolve on an A. We like to hear predictable patterns in music. It's just how we are wired. In the same way, I think our brains are wired to find a similar kind of order in our lives. Atonality isn't a bad thing.

And maybe one day, we'll all find our resolve ;)
