For info on the weird blog name, [read this post](../journal/On-the-Title-of-This-Blog.html). For a bit more info on me, you've come to the right place!

My name is Kenny Xu. First and foremost, I am an avid learner. From photography to guitar, there's always something more for me to learn. And in this process of learning and experiencing new things, I am oriented towards sharing through this blog of mine.

As of now, I plan on writing just about anything, although with a focus on music, technology, and current events. Since it's a bit early for me in this blog, I'd wager that this is all up for change. Anyhow, to start, you can read my [first blog post](../journal/Subways-and-Strangers-an-Introduction.html), a sort of introduction.
